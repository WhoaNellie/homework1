## Introduction

This is my first project for UA's coding bootcamp. It is a portfolio website containing an "about me", projects, and contact page. 

## Installation

To install this project all you need to do is downlaod the repository and open index.html using your browser of choice. Alternatively, you could just go to the github page for this website.

## Usage

To use this project, simply navigate the site using the nav bar. The contact page is not currently linked to anything. 

If you change the styling on the sass file you will have to recompile to style.css to see your changes. 

## Credits

All images are free use, credit to YUI for the reset CSS
